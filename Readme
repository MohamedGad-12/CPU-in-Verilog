# Verilog CPU and ALU Project

## Overview

This project implements a simple CPU architecture with an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. The design includes a clock module, ALU, register file, and a CPU module that executes a series of instructions.

## Components

1. **Clock Module**: Generates a clock signal to synchronize operations.
2. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs basic arithmetic and logical operations.
3. **Register File**: Contains 32 registers for data storage, allowing read and write operations.
4. **CPU Module**: Fetches instructions from memory and executes them based on the operation code.
5. **Test Modules**: Simulates the ALU and CPU to verify functionality.
